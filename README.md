# PC-Registration-System
This is a project I made for my campus which is an automation for the existing manual PC registration system.
The system simply registers students pc and their along with theri personal information and stores it in the database. Later used to search and assure that the student is the owner of the pc when leaving the campus.

### Technologies/Languages used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- PHP
- MySQL
- XAMPP


### This is what the register section of the system looks like
